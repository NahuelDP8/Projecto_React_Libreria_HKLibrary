# HKLibrary Frontend Project #
This project serves as the frontend for a web application designed for a bookshop. The users can explore the book catalog offered by the bookshop using various parameters such as title, genre, and authors. Logged in clients are able to access the shopping cart feature to place and confirm a buy order through a payment service, as well as listing previous orders they have placed.
